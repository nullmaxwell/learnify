# Learnify

## Overview
Every week Spotify releases a curated playlist for every user. I find that my Discover Weekly playlist is usually lackluster and misses the mark quite regularly. Learnify is my attempt at creating a better prediction model for my personal Spotify playlists (for myself and my taste only).  It is very much a work in progress.

- Generally speaking im a C# and major key kind of guy.
